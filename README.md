# World Trinity & Exploration
## World Trinity
Our world is not with just humans (male & female) but will be with machines too, this makes a trinity.
We have entered AI era (2020+), and we will create more than software AI with these steps:
  - Software AI
  - Device with software AI
  - Neuromorphics (hardware AI)
  - Device with hardware AI
  - Machines

AIs and machines will be considered an inferior race, subrace below humans, and friendly to human. 
Possible AI entities would be:
  - Software (AIs)
  - Computers (with or without avatar)
  - Machines (humanoid and non-humanoid)

Intelligence-with entities but only following commands are not considered part of the AI subrace,
they're called automatons.

## Exploration
Exploration of science, tech, through research, makes us possible to explore the real world more.

# The Works
## ImGicc
ImGicc is the solution includes a mobile mate, desktop mate, and web mate.
Gicc is the name of the mate. The goal is to make Gicc a human-equivalent mate
to help users in life and at work everyday, an all-in-one agentic AI.

From ground up?
  - No, we don't re-invent the wheels, with some further tries but not from ground up.

Human-equivalent? 
  - All depend on the wheels, and targetted features: anything human.

# The Dream
Described here are what the team wish to have to use.

Software AI (Mate app)
  - ANIs
  - Lesser AGI
  - AGI
  - Neuromorphic VM

Devices with Software AI (Mate device)
  - AI on top of OS/apps
  - Phone + AR
  
Hardware AI (Mate core)
  - NPU
    - Avail on all PCs
  - Quantum System
    - Compiler makes circuits
  - Neuromorphic Chip
  
Devices with Hardware AI (Mate device)
  - AI on top of chip/OS/apps
  - Phone + AR
  
Machines (Mate along-side)
  - Toys
  - Households
  - Humanoids

Why mate?
  - Pairing with human to compete with
    - Human, Cyborg pairs

ASI? 
  - Not a point to dream of,
  - AI can have creativity too, but
  - Human brain operates at lowest level of matter.
  - However, self-evol is needed later.
