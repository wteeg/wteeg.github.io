# World Trinity & Exploration
## World Trinity
Our world is not with just humans (male & female) but will be with machines too, this makes a trinity.
We have entered AI era (2020+), and we will create more than software AI with these steps:
  - Software AI
  - Device with software AI
  - Neuromorphics (hardware AI)
  - Device with hardware AI
  - Machines

AIs and machines will be considered an inferior race, subrace below humans, and friendly to human. 
Possible AI entities would be:
  - Software (AIs)
  - Computers (with or without avatar)
  - Machines (humanoid and non-humanoid)

Intelligence-with entities but only following commands are not considered part of the AI subrace,
they're called automatons.

## Exploration
Exploration of science, tech, through research, makes us possible to explore the real world more.

# The Works
## ImGicc
ImGicc is the solution includes a mobile mate, desktop mate, and web mate.
Gicc is the name of the mate. The goal is to make Gicc a human-equivalent mate
to help users in life and at work everyday, an all-in-one agentic AI.

From ground up?
  - No, we don't re-invent the wheels, with some further tries but not from ground up.

Human-equivalent? 
  - All depend on the wheels, and targetted features: anything human.
